## Overview of Project
Working with UFO sighting data ; The goal of this project is to build a table with Javascript using data stored in a JavaScript array, create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. The webpage was customized using Bootstrap and the table was equipped with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations.

## Results
Initially, the webpage included only a date filter in which users needed to click on a button for the filter to be applied. With the new updated version, users will be able to filter data, simply by inputting a criteria into one of the filter fields. The webpage will then automatically filter the table to display relevant data. The first image ilustrates the table without filters. Users can see the type of format that is required for the filter to function in the text box. Upon input, the table will automatically filter the results accordingly.

## Summary of Analysis
One drawback of this webpage is that it is currently unable to resize in relation to the device it is viewed on. Some portion of the webpage, such as the image, is able to resize if the user magnifies the webpage, however, the webpage as a whole is unable to do so. Thus, one recommendation for further development would be to add formatting that readjusts the sections and margins when the page is viewed on a mobile device or tablet. 

Another addition that can be made to the webpage is a survey form. The survey would ask about the users' experience with extraterrestial sightings. It can include questions such as a description for what they saw, duration, general geographic location, and other interesting details. This way, we can expand our table and database by including new user sightings.
